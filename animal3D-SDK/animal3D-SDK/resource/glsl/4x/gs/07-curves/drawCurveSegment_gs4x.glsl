#version 430

// (16 samples/segment * 1 segment + 4 samples/handle * 2 handles)
#define MAX_VERTICES 24

#define MAX_WAYPOINTS 32

// ****TO-DO: 
//	1) add input layout specifications
//	2) receive varying data from vertex shader
//	3) declare uniforms: 
//		-> model-view-projection matrix (no inbound position at all)
//		-> flag to select curve type
//		-> optional: segment index and count
//		-> optional: curve color (can hard-code)
//		-> optional: other animation data
//	4) declare output layout specifications
//	5) declare outbound color
//	6) write interpolation functions to help with sampling
//	7) select curve type and sample over [0, 1] interval

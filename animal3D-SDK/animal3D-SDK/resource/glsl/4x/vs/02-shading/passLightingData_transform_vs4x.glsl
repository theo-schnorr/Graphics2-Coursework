// ****TO-DO: 
//	1) declare uniform variable for MV matrix; see demo code for hint
//	2) declare view position as outbound varying
//	3) correctly transform input position by MV matrix to get view position
//	4) declare uniform variable for P matrix; see demo code for hint
//	5) correctly transform view position by P matrix to get final position
//	6) declare normal attribute; see renderer library for location
//	7) declare MV matrix for normals; see demo code for hint
//	8) declare outbound normal
//	9) correctly transform input normal by MV normal matrix
//	10+) see instructions in passTexcoord...vs4x.glsl for information on 
//		how to handle the texture coordinate

void main()
{
	// DUMMY OUTPUT: directly assign input position to output position
	gl_Position = aPosition;

		and passes shadow coordinate.

#version 410

// ****TO-DO: 
//	0) copy previous lighting data vertex shader
//	1) declare MVPB matrix for light
//	2) declare varying for shadow coordinate
//	3) calculate and pass shadow coordinate

layout (location = 0) in vec4 aPosition;

void main()
{
	// DUMMY OUTPUT: directly assign input position to output position
	gl_Position = aPosition;
}

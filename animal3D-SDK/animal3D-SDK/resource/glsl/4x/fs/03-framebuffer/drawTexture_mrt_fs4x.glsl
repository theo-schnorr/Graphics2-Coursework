// ****TO-DO: 
//	1) declare uniform variable for texture; see demo code for hints
//	2) declare inbound varying for texture coordinate
//	3) sample texture using texture coordinate
//	4) assign sample to output render target (location 0)
//	5) declare new render target (location 3) and output texcoord

	// DUMMY OUTPUT: all fragments are OPAQUE WHITE

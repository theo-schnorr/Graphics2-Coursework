// ****TO-DO: 
//	0) copy deferred Phong shader
//	1) declare g-buffer textures as uniform samplers
//	2) declare lighting data as uniform block
//	3) calculate lighting components (diffuse and specular) for the current 
//		light only, output results (they will be blended with previous lights)
//			-> use reverse perspective divide for position using scene depth
//			-> use expanded normal once sampled from normal g-buffer
//			-> do not use texture coordinate g-buffer
